# Jessica Sun's Mini Data Analysis

This repository contains the mini data analysis project files for Jessica Sun (#69248748).

## This repository contains the following files:

1.  README.md: An introduction to the repository and list of files.

2.  mini-project-1.Rmd: An R Markdown file containing the data analysis for the `steam_games` data set. It contains the code to manipulate data and generate plots, as well as a report explaining the analysis.

3.  mini-project-1-md: An output file generated from mini-project-1.Rmd.

4.  mini-project-1_files: Figures generated from mini-project-1.Rmd. This includes:

    -   Exercise_3a-1.png: A bar graph of the amount of missing data for each variable in `steam_games`.

    -   Exercise_3b-1.png: A bar graph of the amount of missing data for each variable in `steam_data`.

    -   Exercise_4-1.png: A stacked histogram of what percentage of the original price games were discounted by, colored by the review category.

    -   Exercise_4-2.png: 8 separate histograms of what percentage of the original price games were discounted by, separated by review category.

5.  mini-project-2.Rmd: An R Markdown file containing the data analyses for four research questions for the `steam_games` data set. It contains code to manipulate data, generate plots, create a linear model, save various output files, as well as a report explaining the analysis.

6.  mini-project-2-md: An output file generated from mini-project-2.Rmd.

7.  mini-project-2_files: Figures generated from mini-project-2.Rmd. This includes:

    -   Research_Q_1-1.png: A box plot of the range of negative discounts given to games over time.

    -   Research_Q_2-1.png: A bar graph and box plot of the number of games that have various computer requirements, and the prices of those games.

    -   Research_Q_3-1.png: A box plot and scatter plot of how how discounted games were reviewed.

    -   Research_Q_4-1.png: A line plot of how many games were tagged with various genres over time.

8.  output: A folder of various output files generated from mini-project-2.Rmd. This includes:

    -   Broom_Model.rds: An R binary file of statistics summarizing a linear regression model summarizing the relationship between game prices and their computer requirements.

    -   q4_data.csv: A CSV file summarizing how many games were tagged with various genres over time.

To read the data analysis report, go to mini-project-1.Rmd. The report is found after Task 3, after the <!--- *****START HERE***** ---> line. The data analysis report for the second project is in mini-project-2.Rmd. Explanations for the code and plots, as well as discussion of the results, are found in between the <!--- *****START HERE***** ---> lines. Run each chunk of code to see the manipulated data sets and generated plots.
